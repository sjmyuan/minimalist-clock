styled-components: it looks like an unknown prop "backgroundColor" is being sent through to the DOM, which will likely trigger a React console error. If you would like automatic filtering of unknown props, you can opt-into that behavior via `<StyleSheetManager shouldForwardProp={...}>` (connect an API like `@emotion/is-prop-valid`) or consider using transient props (`$` prefix for automatic filtering.)
React does not recognize the `backgroundColor` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `backgroundcolor` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.
